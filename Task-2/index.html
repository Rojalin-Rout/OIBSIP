          I am currently pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Applications (BCA) at the Regional College of Management, where I expect to graduate in 2025. Prior to this, I completed my 12th grade from Ramadevi Womenâ€™s University in 2022, securing 75% marks, and I also participated in the JEE Main exam in 2022. In addition to my formal education, I have completed several additional courses to expand my skill set. These include an online course in Python Basics, and I am currently advancing my knowledge in Python with an advanced course. I have also attended hands-on sessions in HTML and CSS, and I have experience designing user interfaces using Figma. To further build my technical skills, I have completed five individual projects, which allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world scenarios and enhance my proficiency in programming.
